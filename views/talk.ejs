                <p>Beware of the dark side, Luke!</p>
                <p>Somehow you met the impossible deadline, your project is online and you now deserve some time to relax. Other than you and me though, the internet does not sleep and your application is now under constant risk of attack. Even without having access to the source code, attackers have their ways to break into applications and steal or modify private information. Since of course you are following all the known best practices, you know you did your job well. You did, didn’t you?</p>
                <p>In this tutorial we will take a look at various common security myths and why quite many approaches, tutorials and common solutions just don’t quite cut it. Find out what your options are to really get the job done and what you might have been missing in your current implementation!</p>
                <p>That would be a mix of my Security 202 Talk along with the more or less basic security tutorial that goes a bit into hacking by showing how a problem can be exploited followed by finding a way to fix the code.</p>
